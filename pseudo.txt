  {
    for each route on that day
    {
      while route is not fully serviced
      {
        select driver();  // we should use an algorithm for selection to assign duties as fairly as possible. Initially it could be sequential.
        select bus();
        assign the driver and bus for a maximum available part of the route
        update route 
    }
  }
